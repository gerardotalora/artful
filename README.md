## Description:
Artful is a web application that allows users to browse work made by artists
and displayed by galleries. The users can start a new account in order to
interact with the artists and their work (liking, commenting, etc). Artists and
galleries can also sign in their accounts and will have a profile page to add and
organize and tag their work.

This full-stack web application has been developed using the MERN stack (i.e.
  MongoDB, Express, React and Node).
